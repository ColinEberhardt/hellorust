I added a new small example demonstrating how to instantiate a memory buffer from the JavaScript side
and import it into the WebAssembly module.


## [Import memory](/demos/import-memory/index.html)

I also added another canvas demo showing the [FizzleFade effect with a Feistel network](/demos/feistel/index.html).
